# 🚧 AI-Based Pothole Detection System

### Intelligent Road Damage Detection Using Deep Learning

An end-to-end computer vision web application that detects potholes in road inspection videos using deep learning and deploys the solution via an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

---

##  Project Objective

Manual road inspection is time-consuming, inconsistent, and expensive.
This project automates pothole detection using a YOLO-based object detection model to enable scalable, AI-powered infrastructure monitoring.

---

##  Key Highlights

*  Built an end-to-end Deep Learning pipeline
*  Integrated YOLO object detection with OpenCV
*  Developed an interactive web dashboard using Streamlit
*  Implemented video processing + frame-by-frame inference
*  Generated annotated output videos with bounding boxes
*  Deployment-ready architecture

##  System Architecture

```
Video Upload → Frame Extraction → YOLO Inference → 
Bounding Box Rendering → Video Reconstruction → Web Preview
```

### Workflow:

1. User uploads road video.
2. Video is saved locally.
3. Frames are processed using a YOLO object detection model.
4. Potholes are detected and highlighted.
5. Processed frames are stitched back into a video.
6. Annotated output is previewed and available for download.
